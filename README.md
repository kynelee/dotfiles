# Window Managers + Status Bar

## Arch Linux

On Arch, I use the fantastic XMonad tiling window manager, along with
Xmobar.

## MacOS

On MacOS, I use KWM and KHD as my tiling window manager. I've found it to be
quite good (much better than Amethyst, for sure!), although not as great as
XMonad.

I use Nerd Bar on Ubersicht for some nice system information on the top bar

# Text Editor

I use vim with a very minimal vimrc, and Pathogen for installing vim
plugins.
